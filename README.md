# odin-recipes
This is The Odin Project Recipes project.

The goal is to build a basic recipe website.

The first part of the project is to build the website using HTML only.
Basic HTML skills including boilerplate, links, images, lists, and file
structure will be demonstrated.

Future projects will style the website with CSS.
